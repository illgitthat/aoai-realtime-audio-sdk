# OpenAI /realtime -- .NET

This folder contains resources to get started using OpenAI `/realtime` capabilities using the preview `RealtimeConversationClient` first introduced in the `2.1.0-beta.1` of the official OpenAI .NET library (https://github.com/openai/openai-dotnet).

Since `/realtime` is already present in the official library (c.f. Python and JS, where official library support is listed in [the "What's next" of the official announcement](https://openai.com/index/introducing-the-realtime-api/#whats_next)), no standalone library implementation is featured here.
